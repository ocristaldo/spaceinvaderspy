# spaceinvaderspy

A small Python recreation of the classic **Space Invaders** arcade game.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running

Execute the main script to start the game:

```bash
python spaceinvaders.py
```

Use the arrow keys to move the ship and press **Space** to fire. Aliens move as a group and descend each time they hit the screen edges. Destroy all aliens to win.

This project is a work in progress and aims to mirror the behaviour of the 1978 original as closely as possible.
