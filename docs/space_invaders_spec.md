Space Invaders (1978) – Original Game Design and Mechanics

Space Invaders is a classic 1978 arcade fixed shooter developed by Taito. The player controls a horizontal-moving “laser cannon” and must defeat wave after wave of descending aliens to earn points. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the original arcade game’s behavior and design – from the moment the cabinet powers on to the gameplay, scoring, and audiovisual style – intended to guide developers, designers, and artists in faithfully recreating the experience on modern platforms.

Game Startup and Attract Mode

Space Invaders attract mode on an original arcade cabinet, showing the title screen and score table. In attract mode, the game cycles through demo screens and messages while waiting for a coin to be inserted.

After the machine is powered on, Space Invaders performs a brief self-check and then enters its attract mode – a looping “demo” meant to catch the eye of players. The game’s title “SPACE INVADERS” is displayed along with a prompt to INSERT COIN, and the screen cycles through several sequences automatically. Notably, the attract mode includes a playful animated sequence where the game appears to correct itself: for example, a small alien character scurries on-screen to replace an upside-down “Y” in the word “PLAY” above the title, fixing it to read “PLAY SPACE INVADERS”. In another pass of the loop, an extra “C” in the phrase “INSERT CCOIN” is shot away by an alien’s laser, leaving the proper “INSERT COIN” message. These little easter-eggs occur on alternating cycles of the attract mode and add charm to the otherwise static text.

During attract mode the game also typically shows the “Score Advance Table”, which lists how many points each target is worth (e.g. the mystery flying saucer and the different alien invader types). The screen will display each invader’s sprite alongside its score value – for instance, the top-row “squid” invader is 30 points, the middle “crab” is 20, the bottom “octopus” is 10, and the special UFO is listed as “? mystery” points. Attract mode may additionally run a gameplay demo: a simulated play sequence where aliens march and bombs drop (with no player input) to showcase the gameplay action. Throughout all attract mode screens, the game continues to flash the “INSERT COIN” prompt (and often “<1 OR 2 PLAYERS>” as well) to invite newcomers. A high score is prominently shown at the top of the screen as well – Space Invaders was one of the first games to save and display the highest score achieved, though in 1978 it did not yet allow entering player initials.

The attract mode and demo loop will repeat indefinitely until a player inserts a coin. Once a coin is inserted, the game switches from attract mode to a standby state awaiting the START button. (In free-play or modern ports, attract mode can be configured to loop with no coin required, but on a standard machine a coin triggers the transition.)

Controls and Input Mapping (PC Version)

In the original arcade cabinet, controls were simple: a two-way joystick (or two directional buttons) moved the laser cannon left and right, and a single fire button launched a shot. There were also two start buttons on the cabinet for 1-player or 2-player mode, as well as a coin mechanism. For a faithful PC remake, these inputs can be mapped to keyboard keys as follows:
	•	Left Arrow – Move the player’s cannon left (analogous to pushing the joystick left).
	•	Right Arrow – Move the cannon right. The cannon cannot move up/down; it slides along the bottom of the screen only.
	•	Space Bar – Fire the cannon’s laser. Each press shoots one bullet upward (if no player bullet is already on screen).
	•	C Key – Insert a “coin” (credit) into the game. Pressing C simulates dropping a coin in the slot, adding one credit. In the arcade this is how you start play; on PC this key will trigger the credit just as the coin mechanism would.
	•	1 Key – Start a 1-Player game. Once at least one credit is inserted, pressing 1 begins a single-player session (original cabinets had a 1-player start button).
	•	2 Key – Start a 2-Player game. This begins a two-player mode (turn-based) if a credit is available, similar to pressing the 2-player start button on the arcade.

On the original machine, the two-player mode is an alternating play mode: Player 1 and Player 2 take turns, each controlling their own cannon and alternating whenever a life is lost or a wave is completed. In a remake, this can be handled by tracking two score/life counters and switching control between players at each turn. The keys above allow simulation of all necessary inputs; for example, to start a one-player game from attract mode, the user would press C (to insert credit) then 1 (to begin). During gameplay, the arrow keys and spacebar are used to play.

Sprite Roles and Descriptions

The visual assets (sprites) in Space Invaders are few but iconic. Each sprite in the game serves a specific role in gameplay. The primary sprite categories are the player’s cannon, the enemy invaders (of which there are a few types), the defensive shields, the “UFO” mystery ship, and the projectiles (lasers/bullets) from both player and enemies. All graphics in the original are rendered as monochrome bitmaps (with any color typically coming from overlays on the monitor, see Visual Design). Below we describe each sprite and its behavior:

Player Cannon (Laser Base)

The player’s cannon (also referred to as the “laser base”) is the small tank-like sprite at the bottom of the screen. It has a squat rectangular base with a triangular turret on top (in the original artwork) and is usually drawn in a single solid color (green in the arcade overlay, or white in pure video output). The cannon can move horizontally across the bottom row of the screen, but it cannot move up or down. Movement is bounded by the screen edges – the player cannot go off-screen or wrap around.

The cannon’s only action is to fire a laser straight upward. When the player presses the fire button (spacebar on PC), the cannon shoots a single bullet that travels vertically up the screen. Notably, the original game enforces a one-shot-at-a-time rule: only one player bullet can exist on screen at once. This means if the player’s missile is still flying (or hasn’t hit anything yet), the cannon will not fire another shot until that bullet either strikes a target or reaches the top of the playfield and disappears. This adds a timing element to the shooting mechanic – rapid tapping won’t produce another shot until the prior one is gone.

Visually, the cannon sprite remains the same throughout play (it does not have animation frames for movement – it simply slides left/right). However, it does have a destruction animation: if the cannon is hit by an enemy bomb, it will explode. In the original, this is shown by briefly drawing an explosion sprite (a flashing shape) in place of the cannon, and then the cannon sprite vanishes. The player then loses one life (one “base” is destroyed). The game typically represents remaining lives by drawing small spare cannon icons at the bottom of the screen or by a numerical counter. The player usually starts with 3 cannons (lives) in reserve, and each time the active cannon is destroyed, one of the reserves is used to deploy a new cannon at the bottom center after a short delay.

Enemy Invaders

The titular invaders are the formation of alien enemies descending from above. There are 55 alien invaders at the start of each wave, arranged as an 11-column by 5-row grid. All aliens move in unison as a formation, marching horizontally across the screen and periodically dropping down closer to the player. There are three distinct alien designs, corresponding to the rows: the bottom two rows are the “octopus” type aliens (large creatures with spread tentacle-like arms), the middle two rows are “crab” aliens (medium-sized, squat aliens), and the top row consists of “squid” aliens (smallest, with a pointed head). These are informal nicknames; in game they are all part of the alien army. Each type has a unique sprite and a unique point value when destroyed (more on scoring below). The invaders do animate as they move: each alien switches between two sprite frames to simulate a “walking” or wiggling motion as it marches. With each horizontal step, their arms alternate position (for example, the “octopus” alternates between having its arms up and arms down in a rhythmic fashion).

All 55 aliens begin tightly packed in a block formation near the top of the playfield. They move together in lock-step: sliding a step to the right repeatedly, then when the far-right alien in the formation reaches the screen edge, the whole formation moves downward by one step and reverses direction to start moving left. They continue this back-and-forth marching, dropping one row lower each time they hit a screen boundary. As the invasion progresses, the block of aliens gets closer and closer to the ground. If any alien manages to reach the bottom of the screen (i.e. land on the player’s level), the game is instantly over – this represents the aliens successfully invading the player’s base.

The invaders do not merely march passively – they also return fire at the player. As they move, the aliens will periodically shoot downward bombs (also called missiles or projectiles) toward the player. In the original logic, at most a few aliens can be shooting at any given time (up to 3 enemy shots can be on screen simultaneously under the arcade’s rules, since the game manages three alien bullet objects). The aliens’ shots are fired from random (or pseudo-random) aliens in the formation, typically those roughly aligned above the player’s position. This means the player must dodge falling enemy fire while trying to shoot the aliens.

As aliens are destroyed (shot by the player), the formation’s dimensions and speed change. The group will always move as a cohesive unit, but with fewer aliens, the overall update loop runs faster (the original hardware updated the position of one alien per frame in a cycle, so with fewer aliens alive, the formation completes each step more quickly). The effect is that the fewer invaders remain, the faster the rest move. In early gameplay, the swarm crawls along with a distinctive slow “march” sound, but as the player picks off aliens, the enemies accelerate until the last alien zips back and forth at a frantic pace. This dynamic speed-up was initially an unintended consequence of efficient coding, but it became the most iconic feature of the game’s difficulty curve. Each alien is also constrained by the formation: the lowest living alien in each column determines how low that column of the formation can drop. If the player manages to shoot out the bottom rows in one column, the column above can descend further before ending the game, and so on. Skilled players sometimes exploit this to delay the invaders’ landing by creating “gaps,” but it is risky.

Each alien has no individual health – a single hit from the player’s shot will destroy an invader. When hit, an alien is removed from the formation and an explosion graphic briefly appears at that position. Notably, when an alien is hit, the game pauses the formation’s movement momentarily (for roughly 16 frames, or a fraction of a second). This means destroying an alien causes a slight pause in the invaders’ advance, which savvy players can use to their advantage to slightly slow the march at critical moments. However, as the remaining aliens get very few, their inherent speed-up outweighs these pauses.

Shields (Bunkers)

Between the player’s cannon and the descending aliens lie four defensive shields (also called bunkers or barricades). These shields are stationary obstacles that provide cover for the player. Each shield is an inverted U-shaped block composed of static pixels – essentially a cluster of blocks that the player can hide beneath or behind. The four shields are evenly spaced across the lower portion of the screen, forming a protective line that the player can duck under to avoid enemy fire.

The shields’ role is to absorb shots – both the player’s shots and the aliens’ bombs are stopped by the shields. When a projectile (from either side) hits a shield, the shield sprite gets eroded at the impact point. Small chunks of the bunker are destroyed with each hit. Over time, repeated hits carve holes into the shields. Enemy bombs typically chew away from the top, and if the player fires while directly underneath a shield, the outgoing shot will strike the bottom of the shield and also chip away a piece from below. Thus, shields gradually disintegrate as the battle rages on. The original graphic representation of shields is coarse – pieces of roughly the size of the projectile are removed. In practice this means a shield can develop tunnels and notches that the player can potentially shoot through (once a gap is opened) or enemy shots can sneak through once the shields are sufficiently damaged.

Shields offer crucial protection in the early stage of a wave: the player can position the cannon behind a bunker to block incoming fire. However, shields are not indestructible and will eventually wear down. By the end of a wave, it’s common for the shields to be heavily cratered or completely gone. If an alien’s bomb hits a shield, it explodes on the shield, usually destroying a chunk, but not harming the player if the player is on the other side of the intact portion. Conversely, if the player’s shot hits a shield instead of an alien, it simply blasts a piece of the shield away (essentially wasting that shot). This mechanic forces players to sometimes step out from behind cover to get a clear shot at aliens.

In the original game’s logic, if the alien formation descends low enough, the shields will cease to protect or even disappear. In fact, at a certain depth, the game automatically removes the shields (in later waves the aliens might start so low that shields are not present at all). This prevents situations where aliens overlap with shield graphics. Essentially, as the invasion gets closer to the ground, the usefulness of shields ends – either they’ve been shot to rubble or the aliens are beneath their remains. At the start of each new wave, the shields are restored to full form (brand new), giving the player fresh cover.

“UFO” Mystery Ship

Periodically, a mystery ship flies across the top of the screen – this is the small alien craft often nicknamed the “UFO” or flying saucer. The UFO is an extra target that appears independently of the main alien formation. At roughly 25-second intervals, the saucer will spawn at one edge of the screen (left or right) and drift across the top, just above the highest row of invaders. It makes a distinctive siren-like sound as it travels. The UFO does not shoot at the player or directly threaten the cannon – it simply glides by as a bonus target.

If the player manages to hit the UFO with a shot, the UFO is destroyed in a flash and the player is awarded bonus points. The mystery is that the score value for the UFO varies. In the original Space Invaders, the saucer’s points are semi-random (actually determined by a hidden algorithm involving the number of shots fired by the player). The bonus could be 50, 100, 150, or 300 points, with 300 being the maximum. To the casual player this appears random, hence the UFO is labeled “? MYSTERY” on the score table. Skilled players discovered patterns (for example, a common trick is to shoot the saucer on a specific shot count to always get 300 points, but such techniques are beyond the normal expected play).

The UFO serves to tempt the player – it’s a lucrative bonus, but taking shots at it can distract from dealing with the main formation. Because the player can have only one bullet on screen at a time, firing at the saucer at the wrong moment might leave you defenseless against an immediate threat from below. In gameplay, the UFO appears only when a wave has not yet been reduced to its last few invaders (in fact, once the invasion count is very low, the saucer stops appearing). If not shot, the saucer simply flies off the opposite side of the screen after a short time. There can only be one UFO or one top-level enemy shot present at once (the original game uses the same internal object slot for the UFO and one of the alien bombs, meaning a UFO won’t appear at the same time as the maximum number of alien shots on screen).

Visually, the UFO is a small saucer-shaped sprite that typically flashes or inverts its color as it moves (in some versions). It usually enters with a wailing sound effect to draw attention. Destroying it produces a unique explosion sound and an on-screen score flash indicating the points earned.

Bullets and Bombs (Projectiles)

Projectiles in Space Invaders come in two forms: the player’s missiles (bullets) and the aliens’ bombs. Despite different origins, they obey similar collision rules with the environment.
	•	Player Bullets: The player’s shots are represented as a thin vertical line or missile sprite that travels upward from the cannon. Only one can exist at any time from the player, enforcing careful aim. The bullet travels straight up and will keep going until it hits something or reaches the top of the screen. If it reaches the top without hitting a target, it simply goes off-screen and disappears (at which point the game allows the player to fire again). If the bullet strikes an alien, a UFO, or a descending bomb, it results in a hit: the alien or UFO will explode and be removed, or the enemy bomb will be destroyed. In any case, the player’s bullet also disappears upon impact (one shot cannot pierce through multiple targets). If the player’s shot collides with an alien bomb mid-air, both projectiles are neutralized – effectively, you can shoot down enemy bombs, which is sometimes a lifesaving maneuver. Player bullets can also hit the shields: a hit on a bunker will carve out a chunk of the shield (damaging the bunker) and the bullet is lost. Thus, firing while underneath a bunker will typically result in immediately hitting the shield above and breaking it apart from below. Players often intentionally create a notch in a shield directly above their cannon; this allows firing through the gap while staying mostly covered.
	•	Alien Bombs: The aliens drop their own projectiles toward the player. In the arcade, these look like squiggly or stylized “bomb” shapes rather than mere lines. In fact, the game has a few distinct bomb sprite shapes that animate – commonly described as a “rolling” orb, a “plunger” shape, and a “squiggly” lightning-bolt shape. The bombs alternate through these shapes as they fall, giving the appearance of spinning or wiggling projectiles. Enemy bombs drop straight downward from whichever alien fired them (so as the alien moves horizontally, the bomb might fall in a slightly zig-zag vertical path relative to the screen). There can be multiple alien bombs falling at once – up to three are allowed simultaneously by the original game’s rules (since three separate alien shots can be active). This means the player can face a barrage of as many as three incoming shots at different positions.

Alien bombs will explode on impact with anything: if a bomb hits a shield, it blows a chunk out of the shield and the bomb itself is expended. If a bomb hits the player’s cannon, it results in the cannon’s destruction (the player loses a life). Bombs that miss the player and shields will fall to the bottom of the screen; typically, once a bomb reaches the bottom boundary, it disappears (the ground is effectively the boundary of play – bombs don’t persist below the player’s area). The original game draws a baseline under the player’s area, and bombs that reach this line are removed. In practice, if the player dodges a bomb and it hits the “ground,” it’s no threat thereafter.

One strategic interaction between projectiles is that player shots and alien bombs can collide with each other. If the player manages to shoot upward at the exact column where a bomb is falling, the two will cancel each other out in mid-air (the player’s shot is destroyed before reaching any alien, and that bomb is also destroyed before hitting the ground). This effectively lets skillful players shoot down enemy bombs. However, lining this up can be challenging during the chaos, so while it’s possible to intercept bombs, one cannot rely on doing so consistently. It’s generally safer for the player to dodge bombs, using shields for cover, than to try to shoot every bomb out of the sky (as one guide quips: “Always assume alien shots will slip through your defenses or your own shot” – meaning do not depend too heavily on shooting the bombs out of mid-air).

In summary, the collision rules are straightforward: any bullet or bomb hitting a target (alien, player, shield, or another projectile) causes the appropriate destruction effect and then disappears. There are no complex physics – everything moves along fixed vertical/horizontal paths and either hits something or doesn’t. No enemy takes multiple hits; there is no friendly fire among aliens (their bombs don’t hurt each other or the UFO). The only friendly fire possible is the player accidentally destroying one of their own shields by firing from beneath it.

Gameplay Mechanics

With the characters and objects defined, the gameplay mechanics tie everything together into the interactive loop that made Space Invaders so engaging. Here we describe the core game loop, enemy movement logic, collision behaviors, and other rules that govern play from the start of a level until it ends.

Core Gameplay Loop

A game of Space Invaders begins when the player hits the start button (after inserting a coin). The game will initialize the first wave of aliens at the top of the screen and place the player’s cannon at the bottom center. At the very start, there is a brief pause (around a couple of seconds delay) before aliens begin moving and attacking – this gives the player a moment to ready themselves. In a one-player game, only the Player 1 cannon is active. In a two-player session, typically Player 1 goes first; Player 2 waits until Player 1 loses a life, then they take over with their own cannon and the aliens in whatever state they were left (in the classic alternating scheme).

Once the wave begins, the core loop is: the player moves left and right along the bottom, shooting upward, while the aliens as a group march left/right and descend. The player’s immediate objective is to eliminate all aliens on the screen before they either reach the bottom or kill the player. The aliens systematically move and periodically shoot back at the player. The four shields can be used for cover against alien bombs, especially in the early phase when the alien formation is high up.

The pace of the game ramps up naturally as aliens are destroyed. In the beginning of a wave, 55 invaders move relatively slowly in a large formation. The player picks them off with careful shots, earning points for each kill. As each alien explodes, the formation not only speeds up (because fewer aliens remain to update each frame) but also the sound effect of their march speeds up correspondingly, raising the tension. The player must continue sliding left and right, dodging or hiding from incoming bombs while finding openings to shoot the aliens. A common tactic is to target the lowest aliens first or focus on columns at the edges – removing the outer columns reduces the width of the formation, giving the player more time before the aliens hit the screen side and descend again. Destroying a whole column also creates a gap that the aliens won’t move into, potentially creating a safe lane where no bombs will fall directly above that gap.

Eventually, the player either destroys all invaders or loses a cannon. If the player is hit by a bomb, that life is lost: the cannon explodes and is removed. The game then checks remaining lives and, if there is a life left, a new cannon is brought out to continue the fight. Importantly, the alien formation does not reset or pause long when a life is lost – the invasion continues from where it was (the aliens do not respawn or start over for that wave). There is only a short break as the new cannon is placed. This means losing a life mid-wave doesn’t give the player a free pass; the aliens might be quite low on the screen when play resumes, making the situation dire. In a two-player game, typically when Player 1 loses a life, control passes to Player 2 for their turn (with the aliens resetting to that player’s own wave state). Each player’s wave progression is tracked separately – they effectively take turns playing their own game. The machine alternates between P1 and P2 until both have exhausted their lives.

If the player manages to destroy all 55 aliens, the wave is cleared. A loud bonus sound plays and the screen is cleared. The player is awarded a brief moment of victory, and then a new wave of invaders is presented. The game then continues with the next wave (sometimes referred to as the next “round” or level). In the original Space Invaders, this loop can continue indefinitely – there is no final level or “ending” once you beat a certain wave. The game keeps increasing the challenge and going to subsequent waves until the player’s lives are all gone. In fact, Space Invaders is recognized as the first video game to feature endless waves; the design is purely score-driven survival.

Enemy Formation Movement and Speed Logic

The invaders’ movement is one of the defining mechanics of the game. The entire formation of aliens acts like one big “entity” in many ways. At the start of a wave, the 11×5 array of aliens begins moving to the right. They move in discrete steps (the movement is a sort of grid-based shift). Each step, all aliens advance one position horizontally (a few pixels). They continue stepping at a fixed interval, accompanied by the well-known “bomp… bomp… bomp… bomp” march sound. When the formation’s rightmost alien reaches the right edge of the screen, the whole formation pauses momentarily and then shifts downward by one row. After dropping, they reverse horizontal direction and now move left. They then march leftwards until the leftmost alien hits the left edge, at which point the formation drops down another step and reverses to moving right again. This pattern repeats, creating the zig-zag march down the screen.

The speed of horizontal movement is dynamic. In the original design, due to technical constraints, the program updated one alien’s position per game cycle (rather than moving all 55 in one instant). This meant the more aliens on screen, the longer it took to update the entire formation’s position once. As aliens are eliminated, the game can update the formation’s position more frequently. The practical outcome is that the fewer aliens remain, the faster the formation moves – an initially unintended but brilliant difficulty mechanic. At the start of a wave, with 55 aliens, the movement and sound are slow and steady. By the time the player has whittled the invaders down to, say, a dozen, the movement speed has increased significantly. When only the last alien is alive, it scoots side-to-side extremely fast, making the final kill very challenging. This creates a palpable rising tension: the invader march becomes like a heartbeat, speeding up as the danger intensifies. The audio and movement are synchronized in this increasing tempo, often inducing stress and excitement in the player. (Indeed, many have likened the effect to a heartbeat thumping faster – the simple four-note loop of the invader march was one of the first examples of dynamic game music responding to game state.)

The formation continues this back-and-forth descent until one of two things happens: either the player destroys them all (ending the wave) or they reach the player’s level. If any alien touches the bottom of the playfield, the invasion is considered successful (for the aliens) and the game is over immediately, no matter how many lives the player had left. In other words, the player cannot let the invaders land. This provides a “soft timer” for each wave – you must clear them out before they descend too far.

Some nuances in the movement logic include how the formation’s boundaries shrink as aliens on the far left or right are killed. For example, if the farthest-right alien in the top row is destroyed, the formation effectively has a new rightmost edge (the alien next to it). The formation doesn’t immediately expand to fill space – they maintain formation – so it might take a little longer to hit the wall next time, slightly slowing the rate of descents. Conversely, if you leave the edges intact and kill middle aliens, it doesn’t slow their approach to the wall at all. A known strategy is to first eliminate the outer columns of aliens: this narrows the formation and can delay their reaching the edges, buying time. Another tactic is to carve an inner column – if you shoot down an entire column in the middle, aliens on either side won’t cross into that gap, effectively making a safe corridor (no alien will drop bombs in that exact vertical area). These strategies stem from the formation’s rigid movement pattern.

As aliens drop closer to the bottom, their horizontal movement range also gets constrained (since they hit the edges sooner). When only a single invader remains, it doesn’t actually have to travel far to hit an edge and reverse – so you’ll see the last alien zipping back and forth and dropping very rapidly with each short oscillation. Interestingly, the last alien also moves slightly faster in one direction than the other (due to how the timing was coded), meaning if it’s moving right vs left, its speed may differ by about 50%. This is a subtle quirk usually only noticed by expert players.

Shooting and Collision Rules

The interactions of bullets, bombs, and collisions are straightforward but crucial to master. The player can have one shot on screen at a time, so timing each shot is important. If a shot misses all targets, it must either hit a shield or travel off the top edge before the player can fire again – this creates a natural cadence to the player’s firing rate. Missing an alien is costly not just because you didn’t eliminate a threat, but because it imposes a delay (you can’t shoot again for a moment while your missile clears). In fact, each missed shot is essentially a penalty of time – it takes roughly 45 frames for a shot to travel the height of the screen, plus an extra 16 frames if it explodes on a wall at top, meaning you lose about 61 frames (~1 second) every time you miss. Thus accuracy is rewarded: hitting an alien not only scores points but also freezes the wave movement briefly (16 frames) and lets you fire again sooner (since your bullet is gone on impact). Players are encouraged to make shots count.

When a player’s bullet hits an alien, the alien is destroyed and removed from the formation. A visual explosion is drawn (typically a simple shape that lasts a few frames) and the alien vanishes, leaving an empty space in the formation. The player earns the points for that alien (10, 20, or 30 depending on the type). If the bullet hits the UFO, the UFO explodes and the player is awarded the mystery bonus points (with the value often flashing on screen where the UFO was). If the bullet hits an alien bomb in mid-air, both the bullet and the bomb are destroyed with a small explosion effect. This is a less common occurrence but it is possible to shoot down enemy bombs and thereby save yourself from that shot.

If the player’s bullet hits a shield instead of an enemy, a chunk of the shield is removed at the impact site and the bullet is nullified. You’ll see a bullet-sized hole appear in the bunker. This can work to the player’s advantage if you deliberately clear a firing slit: for example, skilled players sometimes fire a few shots into their own shield to carve a vertical gap, through which subsequent shots can be threaded to hit aliens while the cannon remains mostly covered by the remaining shield portions. However, this comes at the cost of weakening your cover.

The aliens, on their turn, fire bombs downward. An alien bomb will fall until it collides with something. If it hits a shield, it blasts a piece out of the shield (much like the player’s bullet would) and the bomb itself explodes and disappears. If it hits the player’s cannon, it triggers the cannon’s destruction: the cannon sprite is replaced by an explosion and the player loses a life. The game then respawns a new cannon (if lives remain) or ends if that was the last life. If a bomb is not intercepted and does not hit a shield or cannon, it will reach the bottom of the screen and effectively be removed. There isn’t a flashy explosion for bombs hitting “ground” – they just fall off the playfield.

One important rule: enemy bombs and player bullets cannot hurt the invaders’ formation in any unintended ways. For instance, an alien’s own bomb cannot kill other aliens if it somehow overlaps (it won’t, due to trajectory, but conceptually there’s no friendly fire among aliens). Similarly, the player’s own shot cannot harm the player except by destroying shields that could have protected them. The only direct threat to aliens is the player’s fire, and the only direct threats to the player are aliens reaching the bottom or their bombs hitting the cannon.

Because only a limited number of enemy bombs can be on screen (three at once maximum), there is a manageable flow to the enemy fire – it’s dangerous but not a bullet-hell barrage. The game even has a slight logic to alien firing: not entirely random, it uses a fixed pattern targeting certain columns more often. For example, column 1 (far left) and column 11 (far right) are targeted frequently by bombs in the known firing table, which is why players often see bombs coming down the edges and possibly try to clear edge aliens to reduce bombs. However, from a remake perspective, you could approximate this with some randomness or use the known sequence for authenticity. The key is that bombs come regularly but not all at once.

Dodging and tactics: The player’s movement and the shields provide the defensive mechanics. The cannon’s hitbox is only as wide as the sprite; bombs that fall near you can sometimes be dodged by sliding away. Hiding under a shield is very effective until the shield has large holes. Aliens will drop bombs regardless of whether you are directly underneath; however, bombs that collide with the top of an intact shield will not harm you beneath it. Aliens also do not stop or slow their descent when they are shooting – they march inexorably according to the timing. This means the player must balance taking shots at aliens (especially high-value or dangerous ones) with avoiding being in the line of fire of the bombs. Sometimes the optimal strategy is to clear out a column or make a gap, then position the cannon in a spot where any bomb falling in that vertical lane will harmlessly pass by (this is part of the so-called “Nagoya attack” strategy where you leave one column of aliens and hide in a safe zone).

The end of the wave occurs when the last alien is shot. At that moment, any remaining bombs on screen are typically cleared or simply finish out (they no longer matter). The game then transitions to the next wave setup after a short pause.

Life System and Game Over

The player begins the game with a set number of lives (commonly 3 lives by default). These are often represented by small cannon icons or a numeric display on the screen. Each life corresponds to one player cannon in play. When the cannon is destroyed by an alien bomb, one life is lost. The game then either switches to the next player’s turn (in a 2-player game) or, if it’s still the same player and lives remain, it spawns a new cannon and continues the fight. There is a short respite whenever a life is lost – the game might clear any enemy bombs in flight and pause alien movement for a second while the new cannon is readied at the bottom center.

If the player loses all lives (i.e. the cannon is destroyed and no reserve lives remain), the game over condition is reached. The game will display “GAME OVER” and return to the attract mode/high score display shortly after. In a two-player alternating game, one player’s game over does not end the other player’s run; the other player can continue playing until they too run out of lives, and only then is the game truly over (both players’ results would be compared for high score, etc.).

Space Invaders also features a bonus life mechanism (configurable by arcade DIP switches). In the typical default setting, the player earns an extra life upon reaching 1,500 points. This means when your score crosses 1500, you gain one additional cannon (if you were down to 1 life left, it goes back up to 2, for example). Some versions or cabinet settings allowed the operator to set this threshold to 1,000 points or turn off extra lives altogether, but 1,500 was a common default. Other than this one extra life, there were no other power-ups or bonuses to grant additional lives – the game is primarily about how long you can survive with a limited reserve.

A critical Game Over condition to reiterate: if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen (even a single invader), it triggers an immediate Game Over. This is slightly different from many later games where losing a life would just remove one life and reset the level. In Space Invaders, an alien landing is an automatic loss of the entire game, regardless of how many lives you had in stock. The logic is that the invaders have successfully invaded (the player failed to protect the base in time). So the player must not allow the formation to get that far – it adds pressure to clear the aliens efficiently, not just survive their attacks.

At the end of the game, the player’s final score is potentially compared to the high score. Space Invaders tracks the highest score achieved on that machine since it was last powered on or reset. If the player’s score beat the current high score, the high score is updated (though as mentioned, the original 1978 game did not allow entering initials or saving the high score after power-off). This high score is displayed in attract mode as bragging rights.

After Game Over, the game typically resets to the attract mode, showing the title, high score, and waiting for the next coin insert.

Scoring System

Scoring in Space Invaders is straightforward: each type of enemy is worth a fixed number of points when destroyed, and the goal for the player is to accumulate as many points as possible before losing. The points for each target in the original 1978 game are as follows:
	•	Invader (Bottom row “Octopus” type): 10 points each. These are the large aliens in the bottom rows of the formation.
	•	Invader (Middle row “Crab” type): 20 points each. These medium-sized aliens occupy the middle rows of the formation.
	•	Invader (Top row “Squid” type): 30 points each. These are the small invaders in the top row. They yield the highest base points per kill.
	•	Mystery UFO (Flying Saucer): 50, 100, 150, or 300 points. The saucer’s value is variable. When you shoot the UFO, the game will award one of these values seemingly at random (in reality following a hidden cycle). 50 points is most common for a casual shot; 300 is the special maximum reward if conditions are met (e.g. hitting it with a certain shot count). The attract mode shows the UFO with “? MYSTERY” because of this unpredictability.

Points are accumulated continuously as the player destroys enemies. There is no timer bonus or any other scoring element; it’s purely based on kills of enemies. Hitting a shield or shooting a bomb yields no points – only killing aliens or the UFO gives score. Because of this, optimal play involves maximizing UFO hits (preferably for 300 points each with the right timing) and clearing waves efficiently.

As mentioned, at 1,500 points the player typically gains one extra life (if the arcade’s settings use the default bonus). For example, a player starting with 3 lives will effectively have a 4th life awarded once they cross 1500. Some machines might also award another extra life at a higher score (less common) or have the threshold at 1,000 depending on DIP switch settings. In a standard setup though, it’s one bonus life at 1500 and no more thereafter.

The score is displayed during gameplay at the top of the screen. Usually, the top of the screen shows “SCORE<1>” for player 1’s score, “SCORE<2>” for player 2’s score in a 2-player game, and the “HI-SCORE” in the center. Hitting aliens immediately increments the appropriate score. If a 2-player game is active, each player’s score is tallied separately on their turn. The high score is retained until the machine is turned off or reset, and all players try to beat it.

Since the game is endless, the scoring system is essentially how the player “wins” in a soft sense – by achieving a high score. There is no kill screen or maximum score in the original (though theoretically the score maxes out at 9999 or rolls over depending on how many digits were displayed – original machines often showed 4 digits, so scores would roll over after 9990 back to 0000, which is a legacy quirk of some early games).

To summarize, the scoring incentives are: shoot the more valuable aliens (top-row) if safe to do so, take opportunities to hit the UFO for big bonuses, and keep surviving to get to more waves which means more aliens to shoot. The extra life at 1500 gives a milestone to reach that can extend your game.

Game Progression and Difficulty

Space Invaders is structured as an endless progression of waves, with difficulty increasing gradually over time. Each wave (or level) consists of the 55 alien formation plus four shields and the periodic UFO, as described. When the player clears a wave by destroying all aliens, a new wave begins after a brief pause. Unlike many later games, the waves in Space Invaders are not numbered or named on-screen – it simply continues with the next set of invaders. However, there are subtle changes as the waves progress to ramp up the challenge:
	•	Increased Initial Speed: In subsequent waves, the aliens start moving at a slightly faster baseline speed. The first wave is the slowest at the start. When Wave 2 begins, the aliens’ starting march is a bit quicker than Wave 1’s start. Each wave, the base speed of the aliens may incrementally increase, making the aliens overall more aggressive. This means even with 55 aliens at full count, the marching tempo might be a notch faster on wave 3 than it was on wave 1, for example.
	•	Lower Starting Position: With each new wave, the alien formation begins a little lower on the screen (closer to the player). In Wave 1, the invaders might start near the top of the playfield, giving a lot of vertical distance before they reach your shields. By Wave 2, they might start one row lower. As waves go on, the aliens gradually start so low that they can be nearly on top of the shield line from the outset. Eventually, at high wave counts, the aliens begin below the normal shield line – essentially the shields are absent because the aliens’ starting position would overlap them. This progression ensures that the protective effect of shields diminishes in later rounds: early on you have plenty of breathing room and shield coverage, but later the invaders are practically at your doorstep immediately.
	•	Faster or More Frequent Shooting: The aliens’ rate of fire tends to increase with progression as well. In later waves, aliens drop bombs more frequently, forcing the player to deal with denser incoming fire. The original game ties the alien firing rate partly to the player’s score (as score increases, the reload rate for alien shots can speed up). In effect, as you survive longer and score higher (which correlates with being on later waves), the invaders shoot a bit faster or with less delay. So wave 5’s aliens might rain down bombs more often than wave 1’s aliens did, making hiding behind shields less consistently safe.
	•	No New Enemy Types: Importantly, Space Invaders does not introduce new alien types or new weapons in later levels. The composition of the 55 aliens remains the same three types every wave, and the UFO behaves the same way. The difficulty increases only by speed, fire rate, and starting position, not by adding harder enemies. This makes the game a test of endurance and skill under increasingly intense conditions, rather than a sequence of distinct scenarios.
	•	Continuous Loop: There is technically no final wave. A highly skilled player can keep clearing wave after wave, with the game effectively looping infinitely. In practice, of course, the game becomes extremely difficult as the aliens start very low and move very fast, and eventually the player will be overwhelmed. The phrase “futile game – you will always lose, but the challenge is how long you can last” aptly describes the design. This was a departure from earlier games that had finite playtimes or could be “beaten” – Space Invaders inaugurated the era of high-score chasing in an endless game design.
	•	Wave Transition: After clearing a wave, the transition to the next wave is immediate and smooth. The score and lives carry over without interruption. The shields are rebuilt anew at the start of each wave (giving the player a fresh set of four bunkers every level), unless a wave starts so low that they are not present. The high score and current score continue accumulating – there’s no score reset or bonus between waves except the extra life that might be given at 1500 points. Visually, the new wave looks identical (just possibly positioned lower as noted). There is usually a short audio jingle or extended invader march sound as a wave ends and the new one begins, but otherwise the game flow is continuous.

Given the above, a player starting Wave 1 and making it to, say, Wave 5 will notice that by Wave 5 the aliens are moving very fast right from the get-go and might be nearly halfway down the screen at the start, with bombs falling very frequently. The shields might only partially protect or be gone quickly. Essentially the challenge ramps up until survival time per wave naturally shortens. Eventually, the player’s lives run out from the relentless onslaught, and the game ends. At that point, the final score is hopefully recorded as a new high score if it’s one of the best.

Once the game is over (whether by alien landing or loss of last life), the machine will typically display Game Over, perhaps sound a brief tune, and then return to the attract mode cycle (showing the title, insert coin message, and high score table). The high score remains displayed for future players to try and beat (until the machine is powered off or reset).

Visual and Audio Design

The original Space Invaders has a very distinctive audio-visual style, despite its technological simplicity. Any faithful remake should aim to capture that retro aesthetic and soundscape. Here we outline the key visual characteristics and the iconic sounds of the 1978 game:

Visual Style and Graphics

Space Invaders graphics are purely 2D and pixelated. The arcade hardware was a raster display with a resolution of roughly 224×256 pixels (vertical orientation). Sprites are rendered as monochrome silhouettes – all game objects were originally drawn in white on a black background by the video hardware. However, many arcade cabinets used color overlays to give the illusion of multi-color graphics. For example, Taito’s upright cabinet had strips of colored cellophane across the screen: often a green strip covering the bottom portion (tinting the player’s cannon and shields green) and a red or orange strip at the top (tinting the area where the UFO appears), with the middle remaining un-tinted (white aliens). Midway’s USA cabinet also famously reflected the video on a backdrop of a moon and starfield graphic to add color and scenery. But in the raw game video signal, everything was rendered as black-and-white pixel art.

The background of the game is a solid black field – notably, there are no stars or spacefield graphics behind the action. This was likely a conscious choice to keep the display clean and avoid confusion (and perhaps to save memory). The result is a stark contrast: bright white (or color-tinted) sprites moving on a black void. This actually heightens the game’s tension and clarity – every object on screen is a gameplay element without decorative distraction. A remake should likewise opt for a plain, starless background to mimic the original’s look and ensure maximum contrast for the sprites.

Each sprite has a chunky pixelated look, with designs that have since become iconic symbols of gaming. The aliens each occupy roughly a 2D block of about 8×8 or 12×8 pixels (with some empty space). They animate by alternating between two frames. The animation is very minimalistic: for the “octopus” alien, the two frames show its arms up vs arms down; for the “crab”, its pincers open vs closed; for the “squid”, its tentacles alternate positions. These frames swap in cadence with the movement steps, so effectively the aliens animate once per horizontal move. This gives them a kind of marching or squirming animation that’s synchronized across the whole formation (they all flip frames together, creating a visual rhythm). The UFO has no animation frame change (it just glides steadily), though some versions might make it blink.

Explosions are represented by simple sprites as well. When an alien is hit, a blobby explosion shape appears in that spot for a brief moment. The player cannon’s explosion when it’s hit is similarly a distinct sprite (often a larger burst shape) that flashes for a moment. These explosion sprites in the original are also monochrome bitmaps – for example, the cannon explosion might be an 8×8 pixel pattern that expands then disappears.

The shields are rendered as blocks of pixels forming a roughly rectangular bunker with a gap (like a bunker with a “doorway”). The shield graphic is actually highly pixelated – as the shield takes damage, chunks (small clusters of those pixels) are removed. In the original hardware, collision with a shield essentially performed a boolean AND on the shield’s pixel bitmap with a bullet-shaped mask, effectively cutting out a bullet-sized hole. Over time these holes merge into larger cavities. Visually, after heavy bombardment, the shields appear as ragged chunks or totally gone. The important visual note is that shield edges are very blocky – a faithful remake would represent shields as destructible pixel regions rather than smoothly deformable shapes.

In terms of screen layout: at the top of the screen, text displays the scores (e.g., “SCORE<1>  0000    HI-SCORE  ####    SCORE<2>  0000”). Typically, Player 1 score on left, high score in middle, Player 2 on right. At the bottom of the screen, there’s often a displayed number of remaining lives (or icons). The original had no in-game UI beyond that – no health bars (each life is simply one full hit), no timers, etc.

The color scheme in a remake could emulate the overlay effect. For instance, drawing the shields and player in green and aliens in white, and perhaps the UFO in red, would mimic how many players saw the game in arcades. However, a strictly authentic approach could also use pure monochrome white sprites on black and maybe provide an option for a simulated overlay.

Another subtle visual element is the bottom “border” line. In the original game, a thin line was drawn across the screen just above where the player’s cannon moves (this line is often considered the ground line). It doesn’t affect gameplay directly except that it marks the lowest point aliens can reach (if they cross that line, it’s game over). It also is where shields sit slightly above. A remake might include this line for authenticity, though it’s not absolutely required – in some versions it’s merely decorative.

Audio Design and Sound Cues

The audio of Space Invaders is legendary for its simplicity and effectiveness. The hardware created sound through analog circuits and a primitive sound chip (the SN76477) – meaning the sounds are mostly simple tones and noises, but they are very distinctive ￼. There are no melodic music tracks in the background, just the continuous “march” and effects. The key sound elements are:
	•	Invader Movement Loop: This is the ominous four-note loop that plays throughout the alien march. It’s often transcribed as “doom… doom… doom… doom…” – four descending heartbeat-like beats that repeat endlessly. Each time the aliens move one step, one of the four beats is played. As the aliens speed up (fewer remain), this loop plays faster and faster, increasing in tempo. This sound has no variation in pitch in the original beyond those four tones, but the tempo change effectively turns it into a dynamic soundtrack. Early in a wave, the thump… thump… thump… thump is slow and suspenseful; by the end of the wave, it’s a rapid dumdumdumdum that dramatically raises the player’s heartbeat. This auditory feedback is crucial – it directly signals how dire the situation is. The sound itself was analog, often described as a marching drum or heartbeat. It lacks a melody but it’s arguably one of the earliest examples of continuous background game audio that reacts to gameplay.
	•	Laser Fire Sound: When the player fires their cannon, a distinctive “shoot” sound is heard. In the original, it’s a kind of pew or “boompe” noise generated by the circuit – somewhat deeper than later pew-pew laser sounds in 80s games. It’s a short, resonant sound that signifies the launch of a missile. Every time spacebar (fire) is pressed and a bullet is spawned, this sound plays. It provides immediate feedback to the player’s action.
	•	Explosion Sounds: There are explosion sound effects for when an alien is hit and when the player’s cannon is hit. In the original design, these sounds are different. An alien being destroyed makes a sort of “bang”/“boom” noise that is short. The player’s cannon being destroyed has a louder or different explosion sound (often more of a deep boom to emphasize the loss of a life). These sounds were also generated by analog means – often a burst of noise filtered to sound like an explosion. They don’t sound like realistic explosions, but rather electronic noise bursts, yet they effectively signal a destruction event on screen.
	•	UFO Sounds: The flying saucer (mystery ship) has two associated sounds. First is its background loop when it appears – as the UFO moves across the top, a high-pitched, warbling siren-like sound plays continuously. It immediately attracts the player’s attention (you hear it start from off-screen usually, alerting you that the UFO is coming). It’s an oscillating “woo-woo-woo” sound that continues until the UFO leaves or is shot. If the player shoots the UFO, a special UFO hit sound plays – typically a loud, extended bang or bonus sound. Often the scoring of the UFO is accompanied by a distinctive noise (for example, a  bonus sound that is a bit more elaborate since it’s a big reward). These were also created with the SN76477 chip because the developer specifically chose that chip to generate the saucer’s sound effect.
	•	Others: There are a few other minor sounds: e.g., an extra life gained at 1500 points might play a brief jingle or beep (depending on the implementation – some versions have a short fanfare when an extra base is awarded). Also, inserting a coin or pressing start might produce a credit sound or start sound (often just a simple tone or series of beeps acknowledging the credit). The attract mode has no voice or anything, just the same marching sound during demo play and maybe a short tune on the title screen in some versions. But for the most part, the game is all about that droning march and staccato effects.

All the audio in Space Invaders is mono and abstract – there is no speech, and nothing like modern orchestral music. A faithful remake would likely use simple synthesized sounds to replicate this feel. For instance, one could sample the original sounds or generate similar effects (like using square waves or noise for explosions, and a looping bass tone for the march). The relationship between the sounds and gameplay is critical: the invader movement sound must speed up in sync with the aliens’ speed to recreate the tension. The impact of this design cannot be overstated – players often felt their own heart rate increase as the invader “footsteps” accelerated, which was an intentional psychological effect achieved through sound and mechanics together.

To summarize the sound cues in a brief list:
	•	Alien move: Repeating four-note loop (tempo increases as aliens die).
	•	Player shot: A sharp “fire” sound each time the cannon shoots.
	•	Alien hit: A explosion/crash sound when an invader is destroyed.
	•	Player hit: A deeper explosion sound when the player’s cannon is hit.
	•	UFO flying: A looping siren tone while the mystery ship is on screen.
	•	UFO hit: A special explosion + reward sound when the saucer is destroyed (often a louder boom).
	•	Extra life: (If applicable) a short fanfare or extra sound to indicate an extra life granted.
	•	Game start/over: possibly simple tunes or tones (some versions have a brief intro jingle when starting, and a “game over” low drone when you lose).

One final note on authenticity: the original sounds were produced by analog circuits, giving them a sort of raw, sometimes distorted quality that is part of the nostalgia. A remake could capture this by using similar waveforms or even sampling the arcade sounds. The marching sound, for example, was a bassy tone that some describe as a marching drum, not a clean digital beep. Recreating that richness can add to the faithful feel. As one analysis noted, the simple four-note background loop managed to create a “rich sonic landscape” and essentially functioned as dynamic music, heralding a new approach to game audio where sound responds to game state.

In conclusion, the original Space Invaders experience is defined by its tight integration of simple mechanics: the steadily descending alien formation that quickens its pace as it thins out, the lone player cannon with its limited shots and fragile shields, and the crescendo of audio and speed that creates nail-biting tension. A faithful PC remake should replicate the timing, rules, and audiovisual feedback described above. By doing so – from the attract mode that greets the player with nostalgic visuals and sounds, to the exact behavior of the last invader darting side-to-side – modern players and developers can appreciate the elegant design that made Space Invaders an enduring legend in gaming history.
