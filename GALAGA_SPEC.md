Galaga – Detailed Arcade Game Overview and Mechanics

Introduction and Overview

Galaga is a classic 1981 fixed shooter arcade game developed by Namco as a sequel to Galaxian ￼. In Galaga, the player controls a lone starfighter at the bottom of the screen, defending against waves of alien enemies. The gameplay is simple yet addictive: in each stage, all enemy aliens must be destroyed to advance ￼. The aliens arrive in formation from the top/sides, then break off to dive-bomb the player while firing projectiles ￼. The player must dodge enemy shots and collisions – any contact with an enemy or its projectile costs the player a life ￼. The game was renowned for its colorful graphics, smooth gameplay, and innovative features, and is now considered one of the greatest classic arcade games of all time for its balanced shooting action ￼.

Game Setup and Controls

Galaga is a one or two-player game (two players play alternating turns) that simulates a coin-operated arcade. On start-up (after the arcade cabinet “turns on”), the game enters an attract mode – a looping demo showing the game’s logo, a gameplay demonstration, and a prompt to “Insert Coin”. To begin play, a coin must be “inserted” (in our PC version we will use the C key to simulate inserting a coin). Once credited, the player presses 1 (or 2 for a second player) to start a 1-Player or 2-Player session. In the original arcade, both players share the same controls and take turns – player 2 waits until player 1 loses a life, then controls the ship using the same joystick and button ￼. Our PC remake will use the keyboard: the arrow keys move the player’s starfighter left or right, and the Space bar fires the weapon. (Galaga’s arcade hardware had a 2-way joystick for left/right and a single fire button.) Each new game typically starts with 3 lives for the player. A life is lost whenever the player’s ship is hit by an enemy or enemy fire ￼. When all lives are lost, Game Over is reached and the game returns to the attract mode/high-score screen. Players can earn extra lives by reaching certain scores – by default an extra life is granted at 20,000 points, and another every 70,000 points thereafter ￼ (these thresholds could be adjusted via arcade DIP switch settings ￼).

Graphics and Visual Design (Arcade Version)

Galaga’s visuals are iconic 8-bit arcade pixel art. The action takes place on a vertically oriented screen with a black backdrop speckled with starfield effects to simulate outer space. The player’s ship (sometimes called the “Galaga fighter”) is a small white spacecraft with red and blue markings, rendered in a few pixels yet distinct in shape. Enemy aliens have colorful, insect-like designs: the most common small foes resemble buzzing bee or wasp-like spacecraft, mid-sized enemies appear like butterflies, and the larger command aliens have a beetle-like or boss ship appearance (often called Boss Galaga). These sprites were designed by Namco artist Hiroshi Ono ￼ and are vibrant against the dark space background. Animation is minimal but effective – for example, alien wings appear to flap or flicker as they move, and destroyed enemies flash and explode into pixel debris. The game’s interface shows the player’s score at the top left (“1UP”), a high-score in the center top, and the player’s remaining ships (lives) as small fighter icons at the bottom. The current stage or level is indicated by small symbols or emblems at the bottom-right of the screen ￼ – in Galaga these are little icons (often flags or bees) that stack to show the stage number. Overall, the arcade version’s graphics, while simple, are crisp and very recognizable, contributing to Galaga’s enduring charm.

Player Mechanics and Ship Abilities

The player controls the starfighter which can move horizontally along the bottom of the screen (there is no vertical movement) ￼. The ship’s movement is confined to the lower area, allowing the player to dodge left or right to avoid enemies and enemy fire. The fighter is armed with a forward-firing gun that shoots missiles straight upward. Originally, the arcade limited the firing rate – typically only one bullet can be on screen at a time per fighter (meaning you must wait for your shot to either hit an enemy or travel off-screen before firing again). In our PC/Pygame version, we will replicate a similar limitation to maintain the challenge (though the firing rate can be tuned for playability).

The player begins with a set number of lives (usually 3). Each time the fighter is hit by an enemy’s projectile or crashes into an enemy, the fighter is destroyed in an explosion and one life is lost ￼. The game then respawns the player’s ship at the bottom to continue (if lives remain). If the last life is lost, the game ends and the player’s run is over. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score by shooting enemies. Points are scored for every enemy destroyed (detailed in the Scoring section), and reaching score milestones grants extra lives to extend play ￼.

One of Galaga’s signature mechanics is the ability for the player to obtain a Dual Fighter power-up. This occurs when the player deliberately lets their ship be captured by a Boss enemy’s tractor beam (explained in the next section) and then rescues it. When a captured fighter is recovered, it rejoins the player’s active ship to form a Dual Fighter – essentially two ships side-by-side moving as one ￼. In dual-fighter mode, the player now has double firepower (two shots at a time, one from each ship) and can hit a wider area. This greatly increases the player’s offensive capabilities ￼ ￼. However, the combined ship is also a bigger target (a larger hitbox) and thus easier for enemies to hit ￼. Notably, the dual fighter counts as two lives tied together: if an enemy shot hits the dual fighter, only one of the two ships is destroyed – the surviving ship remains, reverting the player back to a single fighter (instead of immediate game over if at least one “half” was an extra life) ￼. Mastering the dual fighter mechanic (by intentionally sacrificing a life to gain firepower and then protecting the twin ships) is a key advanced strategy in Galaga.

Enemy Types and Behaviors

Each level (or “wave”) in Galaga pits the player against 40 alien enemies arranged in formation – the standard formation consists of 3 types of enemies in fixed proportions ￼ ￼. From lowest rank to highest, the enemy types are commonly referred to as Zako, Goei, and Boss Galaga (these are names from the game’s documentation):
	•	Zako (Red/Blue small aliens): These are the most numerous enemies – typically 20 Zako appear per stage ￼. Zakos are the “small fry” aliens (often depicted like red or blue flying insects). When entering the playfield, they swoop in and take their position in the lower rows of the formation. Once the formation is complete (or as they enter), Zakos will periodically break formation to attack. Their attack pattern is a diving run: a Zako will loop out of formation and dive straight down toward the player’s position, attempting to ram the fighter or shoot it. They often angle toward where the player is, then fly straight down, sometimes looping back up from the bottom to surprise the player from behind ￼. If a Zako reaches the bottom of the screen and doesn’t crash into the player, it will loop around and return back up off-screen. At the very end of a stage (if Zakos remain last), they may circle the player’s ship once before flying off ￼. Zakos are the weakest enemies: they take only one hit to destroy and are worth 50 points each when killed in formation, or 100 points when killed while actively diving/attacking ￼ ￼. They also fire projectiles downward at the player during their dives (so the player must dodge both the moving Zako and its bullets).
	•	Goei (Blue/White medium aliens): These are mid-level enemies – 16 Goei appear in each wave ￼. Goei aliens have a butterfly or moth-like appearance (often colored blue or white with red highlights). They occupy the middle rows of the formation when all enemies are settled. Goei typically attack in a zig-zag diving pattern: when a Goei leaves formation, it weaves left-right in a sine-wave path while descending, often veering towards the player’s general location ￼. This erratic movement makes them a bit harder to target or predict compared to Zakos. Like Zakos, a Goei takes one hit to destroy, and yields 80 points if shot while in formation or 160 points if shot while diving in attack ￼. One special behavior: when a Boss Galaga dives with escorting wingmen, any Goei that accompanies a Boss will temporarily behave like a Boss (following the Boss’s looping attack pattern instead of the normal zig-zag) ￼. Even if that Boss is destroyed, the escorting Goei might continue using the Boss-style attack loop until it leaves the screen ￼. This usually occurs towards the end of a stage when few enemies remain.
	•	Boss Galaga (Green/Yellow large aliens): These are the highest-ranking enemies, appearing at the top of the formation – usually 4 Boss Galaga per stage ￼. Boss Galagas are larger insectoid aliens (often depicted with a yellow and green body). Unlike the others, a Boss takes two hits to destroy ￼. The first hit makes a Boss flash or change color (indicating it’s damaged) ￼, and the second hit finally blows it up. Boss Galaga have two distinct attack behaviors that they alternate between during play ￼ (unless certain conditions change, as described below):
	1.	Looping Dive Attack: The Boss will leave formation and perform a looping flight path, then dive directly toward the player’s fighter in an attempt to crash into it ￼. Often a Boss doing this will bring along one or two Goei escorts flying beside it in formation. A Boss diving with escorts is more dangerous (multiple enemies attacking together), but destroying that Boss in mid-attack is highly rewarding – it causes all remaining enemies on screen to pause shooting for a short time ￼.
	2.	Tractor Beam Attack: The Boss Galaga flies down at an angle to a certain point and then hovers momentarily, where it activates a tractor beam (a visible beam aimed straight down) ￼. If the player’s ship gets caught in this beam, the Boss will abduct the fighter! The captured ship gets pulled up and attached to the Boss at the top of the formation, and the player loses one life for the capture ￼. The Boss will not fire or call escorts during the tractor beam sequence (it performs this solo) ￼. If the player avoids the beam, the Boss eventually gives up and returns to formation (or tries another attack later). Boss Galagas do not use escorts when performing the tractor beam behavior ￼.
Boss Galagas will switch between these two behaviors each time they attack (e.g. one dive-loop, then next time a tractor beam) unless special circumstances occur. Notably, if a Boss has already captured one of the player’s ships (or the player currently has a dual fighter), or if the enemy formation is almost broken up, then remaining Bosses will stick to looping dive attacks only ￼ (they won’t use the tractor beam when the player has no extra ships to capture or when in late-stage chaos). A Boss Galaga is worth 150 points if killed while in formation (or in the initial “convoy” entry), but if shot during its diving attack it’s worth 400 points ￼. Even more, if the Boss dives with one escorting Goei, the Boss’s value increases to 800 points, and with two escorts it’s 1600 points ￼. (These high scores for multi-enemy attacks reward skilled players for taking out the boss when it’s most dangerous.) Remember, a Boss needs two hits – if you only damage it (one hit), it will return to formation changed in color, and you’ll need to hit it once more later.
	•	Enemy Projectiles: All enemy types (including Bosses and their minions) will shoot downwards at the player during their attack runs ￼. The projectiles are small bullets that travel straight down. The fire rate and number of simultaneous enemy shots on screen increase as the stages progress ￼, making later levels more challenging. The player must keep moving to avoid these bullets while trying to line up shots to destroy the aliens.

In summary, a full formation in Galaga consists of these enemies arranged in a fixed formation (often 4 Bosses at the top, with 2 rows of 8 Goei beneath them, and 2 rows of 10 Zako at the bottom, totaling 40). At the start of each stage, the enemies enter the screen in waves: they fly in from the sides/top in preset paths (often looping around) before settling into their positions. During this entry phase, the enemies are already hostile – they can be shot, and they can crash into the player. In fact, as they enter, they are considered “attacking” (not yet in formation), so shooting them yields the higher “in-flight” point value ￼. Once all enemies are in formation, they begin their routine of breaking off into attack runs one after another. The player must eliminate the entire formation (all enemies) to clear the stage.

Special Enemies and Transformations

Galaga introduces a few special enemy behaviors as the stages get higher. Starting on Stage 4 and beyond, a new surprise can occur: one of the enemies in formation will morph or split into additional enemies. Typically, when only a few enemies remain in a formation (often one of the last Zakos or a Goei), it can transform into a group of three faster enemies ￼. These are sometimes referred to by special names (in the original game code/documentation) such as “Ogawamushi”, “Ei”, or “Galboss” – each is essentially a trio formation that appears suddenly and then dives off the screen in a unique pattern ￼ ￼. For example, one type flies in a single-file line then breaks off diagonally, another type forms a diagonal formation that fans out as it moves, and another (the Galboss) is actually a throwback to the flagship from Galaxian – it appears to be one ship, then suddenly splits into three and zips downward at different angles ￼ ￼. These transformed enemies do not return to formation – they are like bonus attackers. They are always considered to be in “attack” mode (so they give attack-level points) and if the player manages to shoot all three in the group, bonus points are awarded ￼. If the player is destroyed mid-encounter with a transforming group, any remaining enemies from that group will rejoin the formation (reverting to the original enemy that spawned them) on the next life ￼. This transformation mechanic adds variety and difficulty in later stages, keeping the player on their toes. Additionally, there are a few special enemy types that appear exclusively in the Challenging Stages (discussed next) – for instance, enemies nicknamed “Tonbo” or “Momiji” show up only during specific bonus rounds and never fire at the player ￼. These unique enemies are mostly there for extra points during the bonus challenges.

Stage Progression and Challenging Stages

Galaga is organized into sequential stages (levels), each increasing in difficulty. Every stage begins with the enemy entry phase and ends when the last enemy is destroyed. A stage number is represented by small symbols at the bottom of the screen (e.g. one symbol for stage 1, two for stage 2, etc.) ￼. As the player progresses to higher stages, the enemies become more aggressive and faster – they shoot more frequently, swoop down at quicker speeds, and perform more complex maneuvers ￼. The game keeps ramping up in this way to challenge the player’s reflexes.

Every few stages, the player is rewarded with a special bonus round called a Challenging Stage. The first Challenging Stage occurs after Stage 2, meaning Stage 3 is a bonus “Challenging Stage”, and then every fourth stage thereafter is also a challenge round (Stage 7, Stage 11, Stage 15, and so on) ￼. In a Challenging Stage, the gameplay changes slightly: a series of enemy waves fly onto the screen in preset patterns but they do not shoot or attack the player ￼. In other words, the player is safe from harm during these rounds – it’s purely a scoring opportunity. The enemies (often 40 in total, split into several groups) will swoop in various formations (spirals, lines, etc.), sometimes performing aerobatic patterns. The player’s goal is to try and shoot down as many of these enemies as possible before they escape off-screen. If the player manages to destroy all the enemies in a challenging stage (a “Perfect” performance), a hefty bonus score is awarded. For example, the first challenging stage (Stage 3) has 40 enemies and grants a bonus of up to around 10,000 points if all are hit, whereas later bonus stages can award even more (the exact bonus per wave increases in later challenges) ￼. Each challenging stage features a specific enemy type or theme. The early bonus rounds might consist entirely of Zakos or Goei flying in patterns (often accompanied by a few boss aliens that don’t shoot), while later bonus rounds introduce the special enemies like Tonbo or Momiji which only appear in those rounds ￼ ￼. These stages break up the action and allow the player to rack up points and extra lives without risk, adding variety to the game’s pacing.

After a Challenging Stage, the game resumes to the next normal stage of alien attacks. The cycle continues indefinitely (there is no narrative “ending” to Galaga; it’s a survival high-score game). In the original arcade version, due to an 8-bit counter overflow, the game would glitch out after Stage 255, turning Stage 256 into an invalid level (often referred to as a kill screen) ￼. At that point the game might reset or behave erratically, effectively ending any run that makes it that far. For practical purposes, players will never “beat” the game in a conventional sense – they play until they lose all lives, aiming to reach as high a stage and score as possible.

Scoring System

Galaga’s scoring rewards skillful play, especially when taking risks. Here are the key scoring details and points values (from the arcade version):
	•	Zako: 50 points each when shot in formation (or during entry), or 100 points when shot during a diving attack ￼.
	•	Goei: 80 points each in formation, or 160 points when shot during a dive attack ￼.
	•	Boss Galaga: 150 points each if destroyed in formation/entry. If a Boss is killed during a diving attack without escorts, it’s 400 points ￼. If the Boss dives with one escort Goei, destroying that Boss yields 800 points, and if with two escorts, a whopping 1600 points ￼. (The escorts themselves, if destroyed, yield their normal Goei points.)

These values mean it’s often advantageous to hit enemies while they are actively attacking (double points), and especially to target Boss Galagas when they come down with escorts (for maximum score). The trade-off is that those situations are more dangerous for the player.
	•	Capturing & Dual Fighter: Interestingly, there is no direct score reward for letting your ship be captured or for rescuing it, aside from the fact that the Boss that had captured it will be destroyed in the process (giving its normal points). However, if a captured fighter is mistakenly destroyed by the player (for example, if you shoot the Boss while it’s still holding your ship in formation, causing your own captured ship to be killed as an enemy), it is worth points (500 or more points) but this is effectively sacrificing one of your lives for a small score gain ￼ ￼ – generally not a good trade. The design encourages you to rescue your captured ship the correct way (by waiting for the Boss to dive) to gain the dual fighter advantage instead of just points.
	•	Challenging Stages: In bonus stages, each enemy hit is worth points (usually similar values as above for the types of enemies present). Clearing an entire wave of 8 enemies in a challenging stage grants a bonus (e.g. 1000 points extra for a wave in early stages) ￼. If the player manages to hit every single enemy in the bonus stage (often 40/40 enemies), they typically receive a “PERFECT” bonus on top – for instance, a perfect Stage 3 might award 10,000 points bonus. Missing even one enemy means no perfect bonus (but the points for each hit enemy are still earned). Challenging stage bonuses can significantly boost the score and also help earn extra lives faster.
	•	Extra Life Score Milestones: As mentioned, reaching 20,000 points gives the player one extra life, and then another every additional 70,000 points by default settings ￼. These thresholds may be adjusted in different versions, but we will use the standard values. Skilled players can accumulate extra lives by scoring high, which allows them to survive longer in later, tougher stages.
	•	Miscellaneous: Destroying all enemies ends the stage immediately. There is no penalty for enemies escaping off-screen (except missing out on those points). The game also has a high-score table; beating the current high score will display the new high score at the top of the screen (though original Galaga doesn’t have initials entry for high score, it just keeps the top score). Our implementation can include a simple high-score save to record the best score achieved.

Game Flow and Logic Summary

Bringing it all together, here is a step-by-step outline of the full game logic and flow, from start to finish, as it would play out in a typical session:
	1.	Boot/Attract Mode: The game starts in attract mode, showing the title screen and a gameplay demo loop. The screen prompts “Insert Coin”. No input (except coin) is accepted at this stage. A high-score is displayed if one exists.
	2.	Insert Coin & Start: The player inserts a coin (press C on PC) to add credit. Press 1 to start a single-player game, or 2 to start a two-player alternating game. The game begins, initializing Player 1’s lives (e.g. 3 lives) and score (0). In a 2-player game, Player 2’s turn will come after Player 1 loses a life, cycling turns.
	3.	Stage Start: The stage number is incremented (starting at Stage 1). At the beginning of each stage, a short jingle might play and the stage indicator icons update. The player’s fighter appears at the bottom center ready to go.
	4.	Enemy Entry Phase: Enemies enter in formation waves. Groups of aliens fly in from the top or sides in set patterns, often looping around the screen to take their position in the formation grid. During this phase, the player can move and shoot freely. Enemies can be shot down as they enter (yielding “attacking” score values). The player must also beware of collision if an entering enemy crosses the player’s path. Enemies might fire during entry (especially in later stages).
	5.	Enemies Form Up: After a brief period, all surviving enemies take their places in the formation (typically a few seconds into the stage once all waves have arrived). Now the enemies begin their attack routine from formation.
	6.	Enemy Attack Waves: One after another, enemies (usually in small groups or pairs) break from formation to dive at the player. The pattern depends on enemy type:
	•	Zakos dive straight down, sometimes looping from behind.
	•	Goei zig-zag as they dive.
	•	Boss Galagas perform either looping dives (sometimes with escorts) or use the tractor beam attack.
	•	All diving enemies will shoot at the player as they come down. Multiple enemies can attack at once in later stages, creating complex bullet patterns.
	7.	Player Actions: The player must dodge enemy fire and avoid collisions by moving left/right. The player fires back, trying to shoot enemies down. Each enemy destroyed is removed from play (exploding in a small visual effect) and points are added to the score. If the player is hit by a bullet or crashes into an enemy, the player’s ship is destroyed:
	•	The ship explodes and disappears. A life is lost. The game pauses the action briefly.
	•	If the player has remaining lives, a new fighter will “fly in” to take position at the bottom, and play resumes (with the enemy formation/remaining enemies still as they were).
	•	If that was the last life, the game ends (go to step 12, Game Over).
	8.	Special Event – Fighter Capture: If a Boss Galaga uses a tractor beam and successfully captures the player’s fighter, that fighter is taken away. This costs the player one life (just as if they died) ￼, but notably the stage does not end. The captured ship joins the enemy’s side (appearing docked at the top with the Boss that caught it). If the player had no extra lives left when their fighter was captured, the game would end; but typically this event happens when you do have at least one life spare (since otherwise getting captured is just Game Over). The player continues play with the next life, and now has an opportunity: the Boss that captured your ship will eventually dive down in an attempt to attack you with your own fighter attached. When it does, if you manage to shoot that Boss while it’s diving, the captured fighter will be freed and fly back to your control – merging with your current ship to form the Dual Fighter ￼. From this point on, you have double shots (until one of the ships is lost as described earlier). If you instead shoot the Boss while it’s still in formation (before it dives with your ship), your fighter will be freed but as an enemy – it will attack you and if you destroy it, you’ve essentially shot down one of your own lives ￼. Also, if you fail to rescue the captured fighter on its first dive, it will remain captured into the next stages (you might see that ship appear in later formations, still attached to a Boss, giving you another chance to rescue it later ￼). This mechanic only allows at most one extra ship to be captured at a time (you can’t have more than one captured fighter).
	9.	Stage Clearance: A stage continues with enemies attacking in waves. The player gradually destroys the formation. As the number of enemies dwindles, the remaining ones may attack more aggressively (e.g. last few might all dive at once or stay out of formation). When the final enemy is destroyed, the stage is clear. There is a brief pause; any bonus points for stage completion are tallied (Galaga doesn’t give per-stage bonuses except in challenging stages). The game then proceeds to the next stage.
	10.	Challenging Stage (if applicable): If the next stage is one of the bonus rounds (every 4th stage as noted), the game will indicate “Challenging Stage” and a special sequence begins. In a challenging stage, enemies fly in patterns without firing. The player cannot die in these rounds (no enemy bullets or collisions), so it’s a free shooting gallery. The player tries to shoot all enemies for a perfect score. At the end of the challenging stage, the game displays how many enemies were hit out of the total (e.g. “Perfect! 40/40” or if not perfect, “xx/40”). Bonus points are awarded for each full wave cleared, or a large bonus for a perfect complete clear ￼ ￼. After a short congratulatory tune (if perfect) or just the tally, the game moves to the next normal stage.
	11.	Continue Progression: The game loops back to the normal stage flow (enemy entry, formation, attacks, etc.) for stage 4, 5, 6, and so on. Difficulty keeps increasing – enemies shoot faster, sometimes more enemies attack simultaneously, and the special transformations on later stages add challenge. The player, if skilled, keeps surviving, using strategies like maintaining a Dual Fighter for extra firepower, prioritizing dangerous enemies (e.g. shoot bosses before they capture you again), and so forth. Along the way, as the score climbs, extra life points might give the player additional ships to extend play ￼.
	12.	Game Over: The game ends when the player loses all their ships (lives). If it’s a 2-player game, one player’s game over simply means they stop and await the other player to finish their turns. When the game is completely over, the final scores are displayed. If a new high score was achieved, the game will mark it (the original Galaga doesn’t have initials entry, it just displays the top score). The system then returns to the attract mode, ready for a new coin input.

It’s worth noting Galaga has no final boss or narrative conclusion – it’s purely score and stage progression based. However, as mentioned, due to a programming overflow bug, reaching stage 255/256 causes the kill screen where the game behaves unpredictably or stops ￼. In practical terms, very few players reach that, but it is the only “end” condition aside from running out of lives.

Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Galaga’s enduring popularity comes from this elegant design: simple controls and objectives layered with increasing challenge and a few novel mechanics (such as the Dual Fighter and Challenging Stages) that keep the gameplay interesting. From the moment you insert a coin and start Stage 1, you experience a steady ramp-up of excitement — dodging and shooting enemies, recovering captured ships, and striving for perfect bonuses. We have covered every aspect of the game’s functionality: graphics (faithful to the arcade’s sprites and starfield), player mechanics (movement, shooting, lives, dual-fighter power-up), enemy behavior (three main enemy types with distinct attack patterns, plus special morphing enemies), stage structure (waves of increasing difficulty punctuated by bonus rounds), and the scoring system (rewarding risk and skill, with extra lives for high scores). This comprehensive breakdown should enable anyone to understand Galaga from start to “finish,” and serve as a functional specification for recreating the game in Python with Pygame. By following this document, a developer can implement each game component step by step – from the initial coin insert logic and player controls, to enemy spawn patterns, attack logic, collision detection, score tallying, and lives management – ultimately bringing the classic arcade experience of Galaga to life on a modern PC.
